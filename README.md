### Why Developers Should Split Tasks Into Steps and Write a Small Plan  

#### Why?  

#### #What  
Breaking a big task into smaller steps and creating a plan means organizing it into manageable chunks. This includes assigning roles, setting timelines, and defining clear deliverables.

---

#### #Why  
1. **Clarity and Simplicity**  
   - A big task feels overwhelming; smaller steps make it easier to understand and tackle.  
   - Everyone knows exactly what to do and when.  

2. **Better Teamwork**  
   - Dividing tasks ensures no one duplicates effort.  
   - Everyone knows their role and how their work fits into the big picture.  

3. **Finding Problems Early**  
   - Smaller steps help you spot issues before they snowball into bigger problems.  
   - It’s easier to fix a small mistake than redo a huge part later.  

4. **Tracking Progress**  
   - You can see what’s done and what still needs attention.  
   - It’s easier to report progress or adjust the plan if needed.  

5. **Saving Time in the Long Run**  
   - Spending extra time upfront to plan saves headaches during development.  
   - You’re less likely to miss deadlines or waste effort on unnecessary work.

#### #How Long It Can Take?  
- Planning and splitting a large task (~14 days) takes **1-2 hours**.  
- A little time spent planning avoids wasted effort and stress later.

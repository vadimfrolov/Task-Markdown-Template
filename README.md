### Why Developers Should Split Tasks Into Steps and Write a Small Plan  

#### #What  
Splitting tasks into smaller steps and writing a small plan means breaking down a large task into manageable, clearly defined components and organizing them into a sequence. This process involves assigning responsibilities, estimating timelines, and outlining specific deliverables.

---

#### #Why  
1. **Clarity and Focus**  
   - Helps developers understand what needs to be done without feeling overwhelmed.  
   - Turns a complex task into clear, actionable items.  

2. **Efficient Collaboration**  
   - Assigns specific responsibilities to team members, avoiding duplication of effort.  
   - Ensures all team members understand their roles and dependencies.  

3. **Risk Mitigation**  
   - Smaller steps reveal challenges or blockers early.  
   - Enables faster course correction for specific parts of the task.  

4. **Progress Tracking**  
   - Allows better tracking and reporting of progress.  
   - Managers can identify completed, in-progress, or delayed steps.  

5. **Better Time Management**  
   - Easier to estimate and execute smaller steps, reducing the likelihood of missing deadlines.  
   - Helps prioritize resources effectively.

#### #How Long It Can Take?  
- Planning and splitting tasks for a large task (~14 days) can take **1-2 hours**, depending on complexity and team size.  
- Investing time in planning saves more time during execution by reducing rework and improving focus.
